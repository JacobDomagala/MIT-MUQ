    title: Multilevel MCMC with parallel model
    description: Defines a hierarchy of simple Gaussian models and applies Multilevel MCMC to it. The UQ method is sequential. However, the models themselves may exploit MPI parallelism. We use simple Gaussian target densities here, but the example can serve as a template for actually parallel models.

    title: Parallel Multilevel MCMC with parallel model
    description: Defines a hierarchy of simple Gaussian models and applies Multilevel MCMC to it. The MLMCMC method itself allows massive parallelization, and the forward model may be parallelized as well. We use simple Gaussian target densities here, but the example can serve as a template for actually parallel models.
