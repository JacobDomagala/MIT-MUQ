  doi={10.18637/jss.v076.i01},
  abstract={Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

  abstract = 	 {Stein variational gradient decent (SVGD) has been shown to be a powerful approximate inference algorithm for complex distributions. However, the standard SVGD requires calculating the gradient of the target density and cannot be applied when the gradient is unavailable. In this work, we develop a gradient-free variant of SVGD (GF-SVGD), which replaces the true gradient with a surrogate gradient, and corrects the introduced bias by re-weighting the gradients in a proper form. We show that our GF-SVGD can be viewed as the standard SVGD with a special choice of kernel, and hence directly inherits all the theoretical properties of SVGD. We shed insights on the empirical choice of the surrogate gradient and further, propose an annealed GF-SVGD that consistently outperforms a number of recent advanced gradient-free MCMC methods in our empirical studies.}

abstract = {Numerical models of complex real-world phenomena often necessitate High Performance Computing (HPC). Uncertainties increase problem dimensionality further and pose even greater challenges.We present a parallelization strategy for multilevel Markov chain Monte Carlo, a state-of-the-art, algorithmically scalable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) algorithm for Bayesian inverse problems, and a new software framework allowing for large-scale parallelism across forward model evaluations and the UQ algorithms themselves. The main scalability challenge presents itself in the form of strong data dependencies introduced by the MLMCMC method, prohibiting trivial parallelization.Our software is released as part of the modular and open-source MIT Uncertainty Quantification Library (MUQ), and can easily be coupled with arbitrary user codes. We demonstrate it using the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment (DUNE) and the ExaHyPE Engine. The latter provides a realistic, large-scale tsunami model in which we identify the source of a tsunami from buoy-elevation data.},
